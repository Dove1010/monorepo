/**
 * Security Properties for UpgradeableProxy Contract
 * 
 * This file documents the security invariants that the UpgradeableProxy contract
 * must maintain to ensure safe and secure upgrades.
 */

/**
 * Invariant 1: Admin-Only Upgrade
 * 
 * Only the current admin can propose and confirm upgrades.
 * 
 * Rationale: Prevents unauthorized parties from changing the contract implementation,
 * which could introduce malicious code or break functionality.
 * 
 * Enforcement: The `propose_upgrade`, `confirm_upgrade`, and `cancel_upgrade` functions
 * check that the caller is the current admin using `require_admin()`.
 * 
 * Violation Impact: If violated, an attacker could replace the implementation with
 * malicious code, steal funds, or destroy contract functionality.
 */

/**
 * Invariant 2: State Preservation Across Upgrades
 * 
 * Contract state must be preserved when the implementation is upgraded.
 * 
 * Rationale: Users expect their data (balances, permissions, settings) to persist
 * across upgrades. Losing state would result in loss of funds or functionality.
 * 
 * Enforcement: The proxy pattern uses persistent storage that is not tied to the
 * implementation code. The upgrade process only changes the code pointer,
 * not the storage.
 * 
 * Violation Impact: If violated, users could lose their balances, permissions,
 * or other critical data during an upgrade.
 */

/**
 * Invariant 3: No Proxy Reentrancy
 * 
 * The proxy should not allow reentrant calls during upgrade operations.
 * 
 * Rationale: Reentrancy during upgrades could allow an attacker to manipulate
 * the upgrade process or exploit inconsistent state.
 * 
 * Enforcement: The contract uses Soroban's native reentrancy protection.
 * Upgrade operations should be atomic and not call external contracts.
 * 
 * Violation Impact: If violated, an attacker could exploit inconsistent state
 * during upgrades to steal funds or manipulate the upgrade process.
 */

/**
 * Invariant 4: Upgrade Delay Rules (Timelock)
 * 
 * When implemented, upgrades must respect a minimum delay between proposal
 * and confirmation to give users time to react.
 * 
 * Rationale: Users need time to review proposed upgrades and decide whether
 * to continue using the service. Immediate upgrades could introduce bugs or
 * malicious code without warning.
 * 
 * Enforcement: The `confirm_upgrade` function should check that sufficient
 * time has passed since the upgrade was proposed (e.g., 24-48 hours).
 * 
 * Violation Impact: If violated, admins could push malicious or buggy upgrades
 * without giving users time to exit or object.
 * 
 * Note: The current implementation does not include timelock. This invariant
 * documents the expected behavior when timelock is added.
 */

/**
 * Invariant 5: Paused State Persistence
 * 
 * When implemented, the paused state must persist across upgrades.
 * 
 * Rationale: If a contract is paused due to an emergency, it should remain
 * paused after an upgrade to prevent resuming operations before the issue is resolved.
 * 
 * Enforcement: The paused flag is stored in persistent storage and is not
 * affected by the upgrade process.
 * 
 * Violation Impact: If violated, an emergency pause could be accidentally
 * lifted during an upgrade, allowing operations to resume before the issue is fixed.
 * 
 * Note: The current implementation does not include pause functionality. This
 * invariant documents the expected behavior when pause is added.
 */

/**
 * Invariant 6: Zero Address Protection
 * 
 * Critical addresses (admin, approver, implementation) must not be set to
 * the zero address.
 * 
 * Rationale: The zero address is a special address that typically represents
 * "no address" or "invalid address". Setting critical roles to zero address
 * could lock the contract or make it unusable.
 * 
 * Enforcement: Functions that set admin, approver, or implementation should
 * validate that the address is not the zero address.
 * 
 * Violation Impact: If violated, the contract could become permanently locked
 * (if admin is set to zero) or lose critical functionality.
 * 
 * Note: The current implementation does not explicitly reject zero addresses.
 * This invariant documents the expected security property.
 */

/**
 * Invariant 7: Two-Step Upgrade Process
 * 
 * Upgrades must require both proposal and confirmation (by different parties).
 * 
 * Rationale: A two-step process with separate roles (admin and approver) provides
 * a check against unilateral upgrades. This reduces the risk of a compromised
 * admin key being used to push malicious upgrades.
 * 
 * Enforcement: The `propose_upgrade` function can only be called by the admin,
 * and the `confirm_upgrade` function requires the approver's signature.
 * 
 * Violation Impact: If violated, a single compromised key could immediately
 * upgrade the contract without any oversight.
 */

/**
 * Invariant 8: Implementation Hash Validation
 * 
 * The implementation hash must be validated before confirming an upgrade.
 * 
 * Rationale: Ensures that the implementation being upgraded to is the one that
 * was proposed, preventing substitution attacks.
 * 
 * Enforcement: The `confirm_upgrade` function should verify that the hash
 * matches the one stored in `PendingUpgrade`.
 * 
 * Violation Impact: If violated, an attacker could substitute a different
 * implementation than the one proposed, potentially introducing malicious code.
 */

/**
 * Invariant 9: Event Emission for Critical Operations
 * 
 * All critical operations (upgrade, admin transfer, etc.) must emit events.
 * 
 * Rationale: Events provide transparency and allow off-chain monitoring systems
 * to track contract state changes. This is essential for security monitoring
 * and auditing.
 * 
 * Enforcement: Functions like `propose_upgrade`, `confirm_upgrade`, and
 * `transfer_admin` must emit appropriate events.
 * 
 * Violation Impact: If violated, off-chain monitoring systems cannot detect
 * critical state changes, making it harder to detect malicious activity.
 */

/**
 * Invariant 10: Admin Transfer Approval
 * 
 * Admin transfer must require explicit approval from the current admin.
 * 
 * Rationale: Prevents unauthorized transfer of admin rights, which would give
 * full control over the contract to a malicious party.
 * 
 * Enforcement: The `transfer_admin` function checks that the caller is the
 * current admin using `require_admin()`.
 * 
 * Violation Impact: If violated, an attacker could transfer admin rights to
 * themselves and gain full control over the contract.
